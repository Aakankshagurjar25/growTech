    <h3>Modi govt failed to deliver on promises, alleges Congress MP Pramod Tiwari</h3>
    <img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-06/17/full/1718587897-9944.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(826,465)"

        Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari accused the Narendra Modi government on Tuesday of betraying people during
        its 10-year rule, saying it failed to deliver on promises, whether on bringing back black money, stopping
        corruption or controlling price rise.
        Participating in a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the Motion of Thanks for the president's address to a joint
        sitting of Parliament, Tiwari said the prices of several commodities have touched a multi-decade high, but the
        issue found no reference in President Droupadi Murmu's speech.
        He said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to deliver on any of the promises it made to people and
        it reflected in the results of the just-concluded Lok Sabha polls, where the party lost a significant number of
        seats.
        "You must ponder on why you could not get 400-plus seats," Tiwari said, referring to the BJP's slogan of "400
        par" (the NDA will win more than 400 seats).
        The Congress leader also lamented that there was no reference to the Manipur issue in the president's speech.
        He said the government had promised that the prices of petrol and diesel will be reduced, but that did not
        happen despite the falling prices of crude oil in global markets.

    <h3>'Balak Buddhi, Parasite And Anecdotes': PM Modi's Scathing Reply To Rahul Gandhi, Congress In Lok Sabha</h3>
    <img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/modi-lok-sabha-speech-motion-of-thanks-2024-07-8df5f2507cd21fecb6ad61f020f3e364.jpg?impolicy=website&width=640&height=480"

    <p>
        A riposte to Rahul Gandhi’s fiery speech in the Lower House, anecdotes, and a fresh assault calling the Congress
        party a “parasite”. That’s how Prime Minister Narendra Modi tore into his political opponent in his reply to the
        Motion of Thanks to the President’s address in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, a day after Gandhi’s speech triggered a
        massive controversy.

        The PM’s message: accept the mandate of the Lok Sabha elections and introspect, instead of claiming moral
        victory with just 99 of India’s 543 Lok Sabha seats in kitty. To drive his point home, he used data, relied at
        times on humour, issued sombre warnings in the same breath against what he called attempts to spread “anarchy”
        and misinformation, and also launched a direct attack on Gandhi.

        He criticised what he called “balak buddhi [child-like intelligence]” of Gandhi without mentioning his name.
        “Yesterday, we saw childish behaviour in the House,” PM Modi continued, “Speaker sir…you endure everything with
        a smile, but something has to be done about yesterday [Monday’s speech by Gandhi]. Otherwise, it will not be
        good for Parliament…these attempts should not be ignored…There is a deeper conspiracy.”

    <h3>Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli announce retirement from T20Is after India’s World Cup win over South Africa</h3>
    <img src="https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/07/20240702062733_rohitvirat.png?impolicy=website&width=770&height=431" alt="" height="150">
    <p>
        India skipper Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from T20 Internationals after guiding the team to its second
        World Cup in the format, describing it as the perfect time to “say goodbye”.
        This was after his long-time teammate Virat Kohli brought down curtains on his fabled career minutes after India
        defeated South Africa by seven runs at the Kensington Oval in the final.
        “This was my last game as well. No better time to say goodbye. I wanted this (trophy) badly. It’s very hard to
        put in words,” Rohit told the post-match press conference.

        Virat Kohli announces retirement from T20Is
        Star batter Virat Kohli on Saturday announced his retirement from T20 Internationals after guiding India to
        their second T20 World Cup win here.

        Kohli anchored the innings with a match-winning 59-ball 76 with two sixes and six fours to lift India from a
        precarious 34 for three inside the powerplay, to a formidable 176 for seven, cornerstone of India’s 7-run
        victory over South Africa.
        Kohli said after collecting the Man of the Match award that it was his las T20I match for India.

        “This was my last T20 World Cup, this is exactly what we wanted to achieve,” Kohli told the broadcast after
        India’s win in a global tournament after 11 years.

    <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo confirms Euro 2024 will be his ‘last European Championship’</h3>
    <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/CR7-20.jpg?w=640" alt="">
    <p>
        Portugal talisman Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed to Portuguese public broadcaster RTP on Monday that this was going
        to be his last European Championship.

        “It is, without doubt, my last European Championship. But I’m not emotional about that. I’m moved by all that
        football means — by the enthusiasm I have for the game, the enthusiasm for seeing my supporters, my family, the
        affection people have for me,” Ronaldo said after Portugal scraped past Slovenia to the quarterfinal after a 3-0
        win on penalties.

        Ronaldo hasn’t had the best tournament with the 39-year-old failing to find the net in the 4 matches he has
        played thus far. He had a golden chance to break his duck against Slovenia in the Round of 16 encounter when
        Portugal were awarded a penalty in Extra Time but Jan Oblak made a terrific save to deny the Al Nassr player.

    </h3>
    <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Sai-Jitesh-and-Harshit.jpg?w=640" alt="">
    <p>
        The men’s selection committee has named opener Sai Sudharsan, wicketkeeper-batsman Jitesh Sharma and pacer
        Harshit Rana as replacements for Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube and Yashasvi Jaiswal for the first two T20Is against
        Zimbabwe. This is a maiden call-up for Delhi pacer Harshit Rana, who has had an excellent IPL season with
        Kolkata Knight Riders.

        The trio of Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who were originally slated to join the
        Zimbabwe-bound squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series starting July 6, will travel to India first with
        the rest of the ICC T20 World Cup-winning Indian squad before departing for Harare.

        The series also handed a maiden senior national call-up for young IPL stars Abhishek Sharma, Dhruv Jurel, Riyan
        Parag and Tushar Deshpande. All-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy who was initially named in the squad was withdrawn
        due to an injury, with the BCCI naming Dube as his replacement.
